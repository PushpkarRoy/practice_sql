# 📊 Practice SQL – Window Functions Mastery Project

Welcome to the **Practice SQL** project — a collection of real-world SQL questions focused on mastering **Window Functions**. This project is built around a realistic business scenario involving sales reps, clients, and sales performance data.

> ✅ Ideal for Data Analyst / BI Analyst roles (6–10 LPA level)

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project is designed to strengthen your command over **advanced SQL concepts**, especially **analytic/window functions** such as:
- `ROW_NUMBER()`
- `RANK()`, `DENSE_RANK()`
- `LAG()` / `LEAD()`
